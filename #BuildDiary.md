#Project Detail.
-Here i'm creating an uber-clone app.
-fun-fact: I don't enjoy using the word master i prefer main, i think the word master has many connotation to  it, because when i think master i think american slavery 'master', then i go to master your destiny.

# Bugs-Report
-finally found the bug that has been giving me problems, After i have been trying to fix this bug for a day and a half now i have found the problem. but let me put it on record that chatGPT has officialy dissapointed me. 
-chatGPT does not provide assistance as good as i would have hoped, like they completely didn't help me in the bugs i found in this build, i used to say the I in (AI) is lound but now (Is not make sure).
-the bug in my code was not breaking my build but just an alert which was kinda annoying, so after all my debuging energy was depleted i decided to just create anouther branch from main and build again, mind you i'm half-way done with my build and due to my programming experience i had created a branch and the problem started in that branch.
-so i ceated the new branch and when i was working on it i got an error(those guesable ones), but this time i decided to learn how to read expo error messages and see how do they point to where the error is, which helped because after xixing those 2errors i was able to read the error message and know where it is pointing me to.
-after learning to read these errors that's when i cam back here toput my knowledge to the test and i was able with on go to pin point where the error was and resolve it.
-fun times i tell you.
-i like how there is no auto-correct here by default my spelling is right.

-chatGPT just saved me. I deduce that chatGPT is more usefull when the outcome is already know, but i also knew the outcome yesterday i wanted it to find bugs, my question was where does the code break and chatG couldn't answer that.

# hurdles
-due to the phone model i'm using (faike) the screen is not displaying full screen and therefore i have been unable to test slide back functionality, now i can't see the Choose buttonat the bottom.
